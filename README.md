# Pathfinding Algorithms Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing and comparing various pathfinding algorithms using Pygame for visualization. The goal is to develop a square matrix board with potential obstacles, find paths between two points (which may be randomly selected), and implement algorithm visualization to evaluate performance metrics and compare the algorithms.

## Project Structure

### 1. Literature Review
- Perform an in-depth review of pathfinding algorithms.
- Understand theoretical foundations of the algorithms to be implemented.

### 2. Project Design
- Sketch the architecture of the application.
- Define data structures for the board, obstacles, and points representation.

### 3. Algorithm Implementation
- Start with simple algorithms like breadth-first and depth-first search.
- Progress to more complex algorithms like Dijkstra's and A*.

### 4. Pygame Development
- Develop the grid visualization using Pygame.
- Implement functionality for placing obstacles and points on the board.

### 5. Algorithm Visualization
- Visualize how each algorithm traverses the board.
- Highlight differences in the approaches between algorithms.

### 6. Performance Metrics
- Choose metrics for evaluating the algorithms (time complexity, space complexity, path length, execution time).

### 7. Testing Framework
- Create a testing framework for the algorithms under different board configurations.

### 8. Documentation
- Document the development process and code.
- Prepare a final comprehensive report.

### 9. Peer Review
- Have your project reviewed by peers at various stages for feedback.

### 10. Iteration
- Refine your project based on feedback and test results.

### 11. Final Presentation
- Prepare for the final presentation of your project.

### 12. Extra Mile
- Consider adding advanced features to enhance your project's complexity.

## Conclusion

The aim is to achieve a mastery level understanding and application of pathfinding algorithms, with a clear, efficient, and well-documented project that stands out not only for achieving the highest grade but also for its quality and innovation.
